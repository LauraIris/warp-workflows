name: display info about cpu architecture
tags:

description: |-
   Gathers  CPU  architecture information from sysfs, /proc/cpuinfo and any applicable architecture-specific
       libraries (e.g. librtas on Powerpc).
    In  virtualized environments, the CPU architecture information displayed reflects the configuration of the guest
       operating system which is typically different from the physical (host) system.  On  architectures  that  support
       retrieving  physical  topology  information, lscpu also displays the number of physical sockets, chips, cores in
       the host system.
command: lscpu {{options}}
arguments:
  - name: options
    default_value: ~
    description: |-
        "--all":  Include lines for online and offline CPUs in the output (default for -e).  This option may only be speci‐
              fied together with option -e or -p.
        "--bytes": Print the sizes in bytes rather than in a human-readable format.
        "--online":  Limit the output to online CPUs (default for -p).  This option may only be specified together with option
              -e or -p.
        "--caches[=list]": Display details about CPU caches.  For details about available information see --help output.
        "--offline": Limit the output to offline CPUs.  This option may only be specified together with option -e or -p.
        "--extended[=list]":  Display the CPU information in human-readable format.
        "--sysroot directory": Gather CPU data for a Linux instance other than the instance from which the lscpu command is issued.  The
              specified directory is the system root of the Linux instance to be inspected.
        "--physical": Display  physical  IDs  for  all columns with topology elements (core, socket, etc.).  Other than logical
              IDs, which are assigned by lscpu, physical IDs are platform-specific values that are provided by the ker‐
              nel.  Physical IDs are not necessarily unique and they might not be arranged sequentially.  If the kernel
              could not retrieve a physical ID for an element lscpu prints the dash (-) character.
        "--output-all": Output all available columns.  This option must be combined with either --extended, --parse or --caches.
        etc.
