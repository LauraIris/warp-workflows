   Controllers require at least one cgroup filesystem.
   The usual place for such mounts is under a tmpfs.
   The tmpfs facility allows the creation of filesystems whose contents reside in virtual memory (RAM) -> Extremely fast file operations
command: sudo mount -t tmpfs -o size={{size_of_tmpf}}M tmpfs /mnt/mytmpfs
arguments:
  - name: size_of_tmpf
    default_value: 10
