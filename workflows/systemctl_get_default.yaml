description: |-
     The target that is booted by default. This is a symbolic link to another target, like graphical.target. This can be changed permanently via YaST (see xref linkend="sec-boot-runlevel-edit"). To change it for a session, rather than permanently, use the kernel parameter systemd.unit=TARGET-NAME.target at the boot prompt.
