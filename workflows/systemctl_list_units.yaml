description: |-
    List units that systemd currently has in memory. By default only units which are active, have pending jobs, or have failed are shown; this can be changed with option --all.
    "UNIT": The systemd unit name
    "LOAD": Wether the unitâ€™s configuration has been parsed by systemd. The configuration of loaded units is kept in memory.
    "ACTIVE": A summary state about whether the unit is active. This is usually a fairly basic way to tell if the unit has started successfully or not.
    "SUB": This is a lower-level state that indicates more detailed information about the unit. This often varies by unit type, state, and the actual method in which the unit runs.
    "DESCRIPTION": A short textual description of what the unit is/does.
