description: |-
    If we have tmpfs mounted at /sys/fs/cgroup. You can co-mount multiple controllers agains the same hierarchy (Collective Resource Control)
    => The cpu and cpuacct controllers are comounted against a single hierarchy
    
    Attention: It is not possible to mount the same controller against multiple cgroup hierarchies. ->  Example: impossible, cpu and cpuacct controllers on one mount, and the cpu controller reused on another

command: mount -t cgroup -o cpu,cpuacct none sys/fs/cgroup/cpu,cpuacc
